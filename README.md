# TempotronGPU
This project showcases an implementation of the Tempotron, a supervised synaptic learning algorithm developed by Robert GÃ¼tig and Haim Sompolinsky. This implementation leverages the robust computational capabilities of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), significantly accelerating the spike pulse encoding, training, and classification.
